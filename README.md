# Dataset Generation

## Watershed_Labeler

An OpenCV-based labeling software to generate segmentation and ellipse-fit labels for frames in a video.

More information can be found [here](./Watershed_Labeler/).

## DockerInstance

While installing OpenCV is generally a complex task, Docker can be used to run a minimized Ubuntu system for added portability.

More information can be found [here](./DockerInstance/.).

# Reading Output Data

## NPY Reader

The neural network exports numpy binary data in append mode. Reading in this data is not straight forward, so this code generalizes python readability of the binary data.

More information can be found [here](./NPYReader/.).
